## Introduction

Kubernetes cluster managed by ArgoCD. Manifests generated by Pulumi IaC.

## Running

If connecting to a locally running Kubernetes cluster (ex: Kind, Minikube), ensure the cluster is up and running before executing `pulumi up`.

Ensure `$HOME/.kube/config` is configured correctly, with the local cluster set as the `current-context`.

Run `pulumi up`. Manifests will be generated in the directory `infra/manifests`.

If the ArgoCD application is connected successfully to the repository, the changing of the manifests directory will cause ArgoCD to update the cluster with the diff.
